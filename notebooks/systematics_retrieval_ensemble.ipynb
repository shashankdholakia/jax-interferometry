    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will demonstrate the ability to simultanously fit for systematics along with the radius of stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I will take a trivial example most often seen with CHARA/PAVO data: observations of a star bracketed by observations of a calibrator which is assumed to be unresolved and has the same systematics as the target star. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I will extend this to N stars without an explicit calibrator--this should mimic the case where the calibrators are not fully unresolved, so they have a "
